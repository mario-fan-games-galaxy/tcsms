Hello, new QC Staff.
Do not delete the Admin notepad accidently.

Even though it's bound to happen, and we've all done it at least once.

Banned \"ASSHOLE\". Still can't really ban the IP without taking \"dj coco\" with it. But do we care?

By the way these dupes have some interesting emails: \"gmaol.com\" \"hotmain.com\"

So the \"Mario and Luigi BIS\" enemy sheets currently in the graphics queue need to be declined. They're stolen - I already re-queued the one that was up for a while; not only was it stolen, but good god were the comments on it terrible. Full off double/triple/quadruple posts, but half of them were in German. - DJ Yoshiman
Also, apparently the Lemmy and Ludwig can still be seen, so maybe BS or some one can just plainly kill off these submissions. In the meantime, I've banned Bowserkid. - DJ Yoshiman
And you can kill these submissions as well for theft. This guy has a habit of not crediting ANY ONE:

Killed his duplicate, \"the black wolf\". I'd ban the IP but the system isn't bothering to tell me what it is. -BS

Someone oughta mute user \"ashole\", I just deleted a whole bunch of comments which was just a wall of ASSHOLE posted over and over; looking for more of his hijinks elsewhere - ZK
done -Char

Black Squirrel, request time: Can you make the sounds section need only one accept or decline? I believe I'm the only one really looking into that section, so that would help out quite a bit. Thanks. - DJ Yoshiman
I have no powers over that, you'll have to speak to someone HIGHER -BS
IT HAS BEEN DONE by RII I guess -Techo
yeah way to be late on the news Techo :)))) - DJ Yoshiman

Banned AwesomeGuy for crappy submissions and suspicion of being a dark bloom clone (his crappy submissions had the same loading screen dark bloom uses...) -Char

Char that password doesn't work -BS
This is looking rather empty -BS";
